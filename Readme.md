## Starting the #100DaysOfCode challenge today!
## My main focus will be on #DSA 

- Reason: building good coding habits through consistency

### Arrays: Day 1 of #100DaysOfCode
with a fresh dive into data structures, starting with arrays!

- Solved a massive sum problem and Compare the Triplets on HackerRank
- Both with tc of O(n) and sc of O(1)

### Day 2 of #100DaysOfCode
- Learned Big O notation time complexity
#### Arrays:
- Solved Find Peak Element medium level problem on leetcode in tc of O(n) linear and sc of O(1) constant
-
