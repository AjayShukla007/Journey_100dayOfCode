to measure complexity we use asymptotic notation

it is a mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity
these are 

- Big O notation (O-notation) which is the worst case scenario
- Omega notation (Ω-notation)  which is the best case scenario
- theta notation (∅-notation) which is avarage case scenario
- 
## Big O 
### time complexity
- Big O focuses on the bigger pictures wothaut getting caughtbup in minor detaills
- the time complexity in this programm was O(1) which is constant in this case because the line in this programm was executed only once
- if there are 2 nested loops the time complexity will be O(n²) quadratic and 
- if there is 3 nested loops it will be  O(n3) cubic time complexity
- and if input size reduced by half every interation it will be O(logn)  Logarithmic time complexity

### space complexity
- O(1) constant
- O(n) linear
- O(logn) Logarithmic
